# pdf-parcel

I'm trying to get a webcomponent working that displays a PDF in elm.  Its not working just yet!  But seems close.

To run this project, do this:

```
> ./getpdfjs.sh
> parcel index.html
```

getpdfjs.sh is required because of a [parcel problem](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/670) - going to worry about that later.  

Right now I'm just trying to get it to work!
